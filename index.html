        <p>With climate change threatening to spiral out of control, the time has come to accelerate our transition from oil, coal and gas to alternative energy sources.
          The alternative sources like wind, water, etc. are termed as Clean Energy sources. And now the clean energy industry generates hundreds of billions in economic 
          activity, and is expected to continue to grow rapidly in the coming years. There is tremendous economic opportunity for the countries that invent, manufacture and export clean energy technologies.
          This is now termed as Clean Energy Revolution.

              For example, Solar energy can be used for heating and lighting buildings, generating electricity, heating water directly, cooling and more. Solar panels allow for energy from the sun to be collected and turned into electricity. Solar panels are frequently used for small electric tasks,
              such as charging batteries, while many people already use solar energy for small garden lanterns. However, this same clean energy technology can be scaled up to larger panels that are used to provide power for homes or other buildings or even installations of multiple solar panels, such as with a community solar panel array to power entire towns.</p>

              Humans have been using fossil fuels for over 150 years and, as their use increased, so did the release of the greenhouse gases that are produced when these fuels are burned. These greenhouse gases trap heat in the atmosphere causing the temperature of the Earth to rise. This global warming is one symptom of climate change that has seen a rise in extreme weather 
              events, shifting wildlife habitats and populations, rising sea levels and other impacts.
              Because renewable energy sources don’t emit greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, they do not contribute to global warming. These renewable sources mean that climate change is not being advanced, while measures such as reforestation can help to alleviate the damage already done to the climate, combining to reduce global warming.

              As mentioned above, humans have been using fossil fuels for decades, meaning that the switch to clean energy has been relatively recent. As a result, renewable energy sources are still seen as being unpredictable and do not yet meet our global power demands. This means that renewable energy is still being topped up with carbon-based energy sources.
              However, it is believed that our energy needs can be balanced by the efficient storing of renewable energy so it can be used when the demand is present. A great deal of work is being done to improve the infrastructure and storage capabilities of clean energy, with experts saying that clean renewable energy could replace fossil fuels by 2050

              There are financial benefits related to clean energy, not least due to the creation of work to improve the infrastructure, manufacture clean energy solutions and install and maintain them.

              eMobility to power generation and storage.
              The expertise that comes with developing these next generation power solutions can be of benefit of those that attain it, offering work and contracts to those who are slow to take up clean energy.

              All clean energy sources are, by definition ‘clean,’ however not all renewable energy sources are clean. For example, burning wood from sustainably managed forests can be renewable, but it is not clean since this releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.
              To be truly clean the carbon cost of production and storage needs to be zero, and this is where sources such as solar power and wind energy are seen as being truly clean and renewable.
